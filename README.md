# BlockBreaker3D

This game is designed as a semester project and built with the intention of bringing the clasic block breaker experience from my childhood into a 3D space. 

## Features

- **3D gameplay**: Experience the classic block breaker game in a whole new dimension.

## Acknowledgements

- Special thanks to Victor Gordon, his OpenGL tutorial [videos](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpBGwZNyUh0&list=PLPaoO-vpZnumdcb4tZc4x5Q-v7CkrQ6M->) were an invaluable resource during development.
- This project was inspired by classic block breaker games (e.g. the one that came preinstalled on old BlackBerry devices) but reimagined in a 3D space.
